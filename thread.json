                "postContent": "Sony's Spider-Man Universe has its first expansion out of Venom territory with Morbius, the Jared Leto-led superhero flick about a so-called “Living Vampire.” Director Daniel Espinosa approaches this bat-man’s beginnings with horror flourishes once seen in his sci-fi thriller Life, but they’re never pronounced enough that they’ll satisfy horror audiences. Morbius presents its origin story with the most formulaic structure, as an overly serious Leto is doing the opposite of Tom Hardy’s campy Venom schtick that so many adore. It’s a choice that promotes Morbius’ moral conundrum as a self-conscious vampire over anything considered “superhero cinema fun,” taking everything deathly serious to an ultimate detriment.",

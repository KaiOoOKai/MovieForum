Morbius presents its origin story with the most formulaic structure, as an overly serious Leto is doing the opposite of Tom Hardy’s campy Venom schtick that so many adore. It’s a choice that promotes Morbius’ moral conundrum as a self-conscious vampire over anything considered “superhero cinema fun,” taking everything deathly serious to an ultimate detriment.","postTime":"2022-04-09 11:20pm"},{"postUser":"kai","postContent":"12312312321321","postTime":"2022-04-09 11:20pm"},{"postUser":"kai","postContent":"Enter text here...","postTime":"4/10/2022 22:38"},{"postUser":"user","postContent":"Enter text here...","postTime":"4/11/2022 00:27"},{"postUser":"user","postContent":"1234","postTime":"4/11/2022 13:20"},{"postUser":"Sidney","postContent":"Enjoyable movie\r\n","postTime":"4/12/2022 10:56"},{"postUser":"user5","postContent":"Nice Movie","postTime":"4/12/2022 11:18"}]},{"threadTitle":"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer Stone","threadTime":"4/11/2022 13:06","username":"user2","threadContent":"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is a great movie","tags":"Harry Potter","posts":[{"postUser":"user2","postContent":"Enter text here...","postTime":"4/11/2022 15:38"},{"postUser":"admin","postContent":"Great Movie","postTime":"4/12/2022 10:59"}]},{"threadTitle":"Spiderman: No way home review","threadTime":"4/12/2022 10:47","username":"Sidney","threadContent":"This movie was very entertaining.
